## FAQ

*Can this be used for Feature Requests?*

Yes, please remember to tag your issue as an 'enhancement' (feature request)

*Why don't you implement my feature request immediately?*

Many people who release plugins have asked that the 'Release' (current) version of SynthEdit remain as stable as possible. Doing this reduces the number of unexpected bugs and issues that can cause a lot of stress and reputational damage to people who release plugins. The best means of keeping a software product stable is to not mess with it without good reason. Therefore it is normal practice for a 'stable' version of software to receive only important bug-fixes and not new and unstable changes.

*When are feature requests implemented?*

New features will added to the next beta version of the product. i.e. SynthEdit Version 1.6, the reason for this is so that only people who are prepared to experience bugs can opt-in to using the beta. People who wish to experience the fewest disruption and bugs can stick to teh 'release' version of the product. ie. SynthEdit Version 1.5
